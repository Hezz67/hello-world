Looking to develop websites and dust off coding skills
I stumbled into this site and I think it will allow me to work on web development and improve my coding skills; I have begun to dust off my html and css coding skills and began a beginer JavaScript tutorial; I am not exactly sure what this site does but it seems to provide me a place to work on coding, talk to others, get help, improve skills and I'm not sure yet if I can park files here and see how they run together as part of it. I am going to try and research the earlier questions I was having and see if I can develop a basic site that I continue to improve upon.
